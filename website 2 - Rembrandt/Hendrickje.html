        Hendrickje Stoffels (1626 – July 21, 1663) was Rembrandt’s longtime friend with benefits. The couple were forbidden to marry because of the financial settlement linked to the will of Rembrandt's deceased wife Saskia, but they remained together until Hendrickje's death. In the later years of their relationship Hendrickje managed Rembrandt's business affairs together with the painter's son Titus.

        Hendrickje is widely believed to have modeled for a number of Rembrandt's works, though her role as Rembrandt's model is disputed by some critics. In 1656 Rembrandt was forced to declare bankruptcy and in 1658 he lost his house. He, Hendrickje, their daughter Cornelia, and Titus moved into a rented property. In the same year, Hendrickje, who got along well with Titus, opened an art shop with Titus’ help where she sold Rembrandt’s paintings. In order to protect Rembrandt from his money lenders, Hendrickje and Titus became his “employers.” In this way Hendrickje Stoffels, his former maid, had become his boss – at least officially. Her biographer Christoph Driessen believes that Rembrandt’s noticeable productivity in the early 1660s was enabled by the obvious support Hendrickje was rendering him. She essentially organized his life and prevented his complete downfall after his bankruptcy.

        In 1663, the plague hit Amsterdam and killed thousands. Hendrickje died suddenly at this time, suggesting that she was a victim of the epidemic. She was buried in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam on 24 July 1663. Titus also died five years later, making Rembrandt’s life a stereotypical rags-to-riches-to-rags story. It’s seems obvious why he appears so sad in many of his late self-portraits.
